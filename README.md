# Guest Manager

Guest manager is a simple guest information management system. It's main task is to collect and archive all the personal information about hotel guests that is required by law.

This project is developed as a voluntary work for my grandma, who runs a lovely hostel in southern Czechia ([Penzion U Rem√≠zky](https://www.penzionuremizky.cz/), located in [Znojmo](https://goo.gl/maps/cUgtFYcQRquecumt6)).

The system documentation can be found in the [docs/](./docs/README.md) directory.
